This is an "NFL-Themed" game created on the WordPress cms. The theme that is being used in Custom-Made. If you like the NFL and Wheel of Fortune this is your game. It has been designed to work primarily on computers but also works on IPads and on Iphones as well. It cannot work on android phones because those phones do not pickup on which key was pressed as they do with other devices.
